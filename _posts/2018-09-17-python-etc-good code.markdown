+ Divide code by function in `long code`
    - Under 25 lines including comments
    
+ Divide code by function `over 2-depth indent`
    - Consider the necessity of for-loop, if statement
    
+ Divide code by function `when comments are necessary`
    - When a comment is needed, it is time to separate the meaning.
    
+ If data are added, separate the code with module or class
    - Basically, program is the combination of data and the algorithm which handles data.

+ Do refactoring first before adding or revising function
    - It is good to warm brain
