For retrieving documents similar to a specific document either the <mark>cosine of the angle</mark> or the <mark>dot product</mark> between the document and other documents is computed.
The cosine of the angle between two vectors gives a similarity measure based on the similarity between their vector compositions.
To illustrate this fact, let us look at two vectors x, y $\in$
