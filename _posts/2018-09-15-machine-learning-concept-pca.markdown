I'd like to start talking about unsupervised learning problem called dimensionality reduction.
There are a couple of different reasons why one might want to do dimensionality reduction. One is **data compression**.
Data compression not only allows us to compress the data and have it therefore use up **less computer memory** or disk space, 
but it will also allow us to **speed up our learning** algorithms.

let's start by talking about what is **dimensionality reduction**.
