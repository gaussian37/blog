When it comes to preparing a wedding ceremony, nowadays, we only need about 10 or 20 minutes  to do so. People attending the ceremony don't have enough time on weekends to buy wedding presents so they just transfer the money to the newlywed couple through an app and/or send congratulatory messages through the SNS. So in my country, the wedding ceremony has changed to simpler way.

### Mobile phone, cell phone

    + I prefer to use a mobile phone because it has a lot of functions. For example, the mobile phone has a free messenger. And I can use that free messenger to communicate with others but I need to spend when I need to use the telephone. So the mobile phone is more convenient. A mobile phone has other functions like storing music and surfing the internet. These are some reasons why I use the mobile phone more often than the telephone.
