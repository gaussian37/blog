This chapter (Deep learning for computer vision) covers

- Understanding convolutional neural networks (convnets)
- Using data augmentation to mitigate overfitting
- Using a pretrained convnet to do feature extraction
- Fine-tuning a pretrained convnet
- Visualizing what convnets learn and how they make classification decisions
